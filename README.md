# CS6790_Project
Project on stereo-based visual odometry for the Geometry and Photometry for Computer Vision course offered in IIT Madras, Spring 2020.


# Structure
A python implementation of [[1]](#1) is provided in the <code>rt-svo</code> folder. 

The <code>s-dso</code> folder contains a modified version of the Stereo DSO [[2]](#2) implementation here : https://github.com/JingeTu/StereoDSO

The <code>s-ptam</code> folder contains a fork of the python implementation of Stereo PTAM [[3]](#3) here : https://github.com/uoip/stereo_ptam

Please refer to the README provided in each sub-directory for instructions to run.
